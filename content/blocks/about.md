# Hi, I’m Mark.  

I write about computer science, paralegal work, and the humanities. This site is both a notebook and a portfolio. I’ve gone through several iterations of a “portfolio” over the years, first as a teacher, then as a fledgling web developer. None of them felt quite right. I always felt like I was striving too hard to impress with fancy styling which left me with a website I never felt content presenting. And at the end of the day, we're supposed to show our portfolio to people, right? 

This portfolio has a different goal: to show what I've been learning by allowing me a place to put down my thoughts, either as an article, or a page to showcase a project I'm particularly proud of, without all of the overwrought styling. It mimics my notetaking apps in that way. 

In a previous life, I was a teacher. I primarily taught Latin, but Ancient Greek, English, beginning French, and Logic were also wonderful courses under my belt. I’ve always enjoyed helping people make sense of complex things. It might have been a passage from Cicero or Thucydides, or a tricky bit of editing in a student’s writing to improve the flow of their argument. **Teaching taught me patience, organization, and the value of clear communication.**  

After stepping away from education, I moved into web development and technical consulting. This came from an interest in automating grading, funny enough. Before AI, there wasn't a decent tool at automatically grading students Latin homework. During COVID, I took this task on and developed a rudimentary script to help grade. This allowed me a wealth of time I hadn't had before. I fell in love with the puzzle. **I learned to design systems, write clean code, and think through problems in a structured way**, complementing the language half of my brain.  

**Recently, I’ve been transitioning into the legal field as a paralegal.** I’m especially drawn to intellectual property, where law, language, and technology intersect. I've completed the University of San Diego’s ABA-approved paralegal program, and I’ve had the chance to complete an internship where I worked on trademark maintenance, Office action research, and IP automation projects that merge my technical background with my new legal training.  

This site is my working space. It is where I can document what I’m learning and share what I find useful along the way. Welcome!

**Mark**
