# Hi, I’m Mark.  

I write about computer science, paralegal work, and the humanities. This site is both a notebook and a portfolio. I’ve gone through several iterations of a “portfolio” over the years, first as a teacher, then as a fledgling web developer. None of them felt quite right. They always seemed to emphasize products over process, and output over curiosity.  

In a previous life, I was a teacher. I primarily taught Latin, but Ancient Greek, English, beginning French, and Logic were also wonderful endeavors. I’ve always enjoyed helping people make sense of complex things. It might have been a passage from Cicero or Thucydides, or a tricky bit of editing in a student’s writing to help their rhetoric. Teaching taught me patience, organization, and the value of clear communication.  

After stepping away from education, I moved into web development and technical consulting. This came from an interest in automating grading, funny enough. Before AI, there wasn't a decent tool at automatically grading students Latin homework. During COVID, I took this task on and developed a rudimentary script to help grade. This allowed me a wealth of time I hadn't had before. I fell in love with the puzzle. I learned to design systems, write clean code, and think through problems in a structured way, complementing the language half of my brain. Those skills have carried naturally into my growing interest in the law.  

Recently, I’ve been transitioning into the legal field as a paralegal. I’m especially drawn to intellectual property, where law, language, and technology intersect. I've completed the University of San Diego’s ABA-approved paralegal program, and I’ve had the chance to complete an internship where I worked on trademark maintenance, Office action research, and IP automation projects that merge my technical background with my new legal training.  

This site is my working space. It is where I can document what I’m learning and share what I find useful along the way. Welcome!

**Mark**
