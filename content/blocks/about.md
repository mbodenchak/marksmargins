  <h1 id="about-title">Hi, I’m Mark.</h1>

  <p class="lede dropcap">
    I write about <strong>computer science</strong>, <strong>law</strong>, the
    <strong>humanities</strong>, and anything else that piques my interest. This
    site is part notebook, part portfolio, and a space for thinking out loud.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over the years, I have gone through several versions of a portfolio. First
    as a teacher to provide extra lessons for students. Then as a developer to
    showcase my projects. None of them ever felt like me. I realized I was too
    focused on presentation instead of purpose. I would spend hours refining
    details and rarely publish anything meaningful.
  </p>

  <div class="callout">
    <b>I want to showcase my journey.</b> This is where I write, reflect, and
    document what I am working on without worrying about perfection. It mirrors
    the plain structure of my note-taking apps and keeps the focus on the ideas
    themselves.
  </div>

  <h3>I began my career as a teacher.</h3>
  <p>
    I taught Latin, along with Ancient Greek, English, French, and Logic. I
    enjoyed helping people make sense of complex ideas, from translating Cicero
    to improving the clarity of a student’s essay.
  </p>
  <p class="beat">
    <strong
      >Teaching taught me patience, organization, and the value of clear
      communication.</strong
    >
    Those lessons continue to shape how I approach every project.
  </p>

  <h3>Later, I turned to technology.</h3>
  <p>
    I became interested in automating grading and built a small program to help
    evaluate Latin assignments. That experience opened the door to programming,
    system design, and the creative side of problem solving.
  </p>
  <p class="beat">
    <strong
      >I learned to design systems, write clean and efficient code, and think
      through problems in a structured way.</strong
    >
    That mindset connects naturally to research, analysis, and process
    improvement in any field.
  </p>

  <h3>Today, my work bridges law and technology.</h3>
  <p>
    I completed the
    <strong>University of San Diego’s ABA-approved Paralegal Program</strong>,
    where I studied Contract law, Business Entities, Civil Litigation, Legal
    Research and Writing, and more. I also completed an internship focused on
    intellectual property and legal technology projects involving trademark
    maintenance, Office action research, and automation.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the same time, I am pursuing a
    <strong
      >Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Western Governors
      University</strong
    >, where I study software design, data structures, and automation systems.
  </p>
  <p class="beat">
    <strong
      >I am drawn to spaces where logic, language, and structure come
      together,</strong
    >
    whether that is in building tools, solving legal problems, or improving the
    way people work with information.
  </p>

  <p>
    This site is my <strong>working space</strong>. It is where I collect ideas,
    record what I learn, and share the things I find useful along the way. The site name comes from the habit of writing in the margins, the quiet spaces beside the text <strong>where ideas first begin to take shape</strong>.
  </p>
